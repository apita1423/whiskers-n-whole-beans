# Whiskers N Whole Beans
Whiskers N Whole Beans is my first project for Code Insitute. The idea came from my love for coffee, books, and, of course, cats. I do have two cats name Mo and Eva and their picture was used for the People page and I am also a librarian. My cats were actually in foster care when we got them, so that also sparked the idea and I was also influenced by the growing number of cat cafes popping up in various cities. And, personally I always wanted to open a coffeeshop and bakery. 

Whiskers N Whole Beans is a business's website. It is intended to give the user information on what the business is, what it does, and what they can do to avail of the services. I wanted to create a site that was welcoming without a crazy amount of colour, a lot of wording, or pictures. I wanted to make it simple and to the point, where it won't be overwhelming to customers, but it still had a bit of fun to it.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme that I used for Whiskers N Whole Beans was more towards warm colours. The main idea of the site is to be a place where you can relax and feel at home. For many people, sitting on a chair with a cat on their lap purring, drinking tea or coffee, and having pastries can materialise warmth and relaxation. It does for me and bringing in some Autumn colours creates that atmosphere.

### Typography
Two fonts I used from Google Fonts where for the body Pangolin and for h1, h2, and h3 I used Shadows Into Light Two. My default font was Sans-serif. I decided on Pangolin and Shadows Into Light Two because of their playful. They capture the overall idea of the website, which is playful. Calm, but playful (just like the cats). 

- Shadow Into Light Two - Used for Headings

- Pangolin Font - Used for Body

### Imagery
For the imagery of the site, I wanted to show cats doing what cats do best sleeping or getting up to no good. Cats have unique personalities and I tried to find pictures that once you looked at them you know there is a unique personality behind that face. I also wanted some soft tones to the pictures, but every now and then there is a pop of colour to the photos. My favourite colours are autumn colours (orange and brown), so you will find those colours throughout the site.

## Features

### General features on each page

### Future Implementations
- To set up a live feed of the cat area.
- Add a coffee page to the website - a coffee section was thought of in the wireframes, but it was a lot for my knowledge at the time and actual time.
- Add a newsletter for updates on the cats or when cats are adopted - this was also part of my ideas at the beginning, but again knowledge and time. (add link to wireframe)
- In the book here section, add a Manage Your Reservation. A customer would be able to create an account sign-in and cancel or if they would need to rescedule - this was also an idea that I had at the beginning, but same issue as above. (add link to wireframe)
- I know many of the future implementaions were ideas that I thought of from the beginning, but as my knowledge grows I would like to test them on this project. (add link to wireframe)
