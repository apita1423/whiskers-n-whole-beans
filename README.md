# Whiskers N Whole Beans
Whiskers N Whole Beans is my first project for Code Institute. The idea came from my love for coffee, books, and, of course, cats. I do have two cats name Mo and Eva and their picture was used for the People page and I am also a librarian. My cats were actually in foster care when we got them, so that sparked the idea and was also influenced by the growing number of cat cafes popping up in various cities. And, personally, I always wanted to open a coffeeshop and bakery. 

Whiskers N Whole Beans is a business's website. It is intended to give users information on what the business is, what it does, and what they can do to avail of the services. I wanted to create a site that was welcoming without a crazy amount of colour, a lot of wording, or pictures. I wanted to make it simple and to the point, where it won't be overwhelming to customers, but it still had a bit of fun to it.

## User Experience

### User Stories
Cats are known for their calm nature just laying their sleeping for hours upon hours. I wanted to convey that calm nature through the website. For first time users, I wanted them to feel like there wasn't so much being thrown at them. For returning users, I wanted the website to feel like when the users is in need of some relaxation, coffee/tea/pastry, and want to hang out with cats, they know exactly where to go. Working as a librarian, and having multiple patrons come to me asking me questions, I want to look at a website and not feel like I need to jump through multiple hoops to just get a answer. That is what I wanted the website to be. That is why I linked the different pages through the text. A user wants to read the first page, but wants to quickly go to the Book Here page they can do that. They want to find out about the DSPCA, there is a link for that right in the Home page. For returning users, they can click right on the Book Here menu right from the Home page and don't have to go through all the pages (in future implementation I mentioned that I wanted to add a Manage Your Reservation section, which allows the user to cancel if they need to or change time of their reservation). The main goal of the website was that the users does not have to jump through multiple hoops just to get what they want.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme that I used for Whiskers N Whole Beans was more towards warm colours. The main idea of the site is to be a place where you can relax and feel at home. For many people, sitting on a chair with a purring cat on their lap, drinking tea or coffee, and having pastries can materialise warmth and relaxation. It does for me and bringing in some autumn colours creates that atmosphere. 

![Whiskers N Whole Beans Colour Scheme](/assets/readme-images/colour-scheme.png)

### Typography
The two fonts I used are from Google Fonts. The font used for the body was Pangolin and for h1, h2, and h3 was Shadows Into Light Two. My default font was Sans-serif. I decided on Pangolin and Shadows Into Light Two because of their playful nature. They capture the overall idea of the website, which is playful. Calm, but playful (just like the cats). 

- Shadow Into Light Two - Used for Headings

![Shadow Into Light Two](/assets/readme-images/headings-fonts-readme.png)

- Pangolin Font - Used for Body

![Pangolin Font](/assets/readme-images/body-font-readme.png)

I did have one problem that showed up in the editor (CSS), but passed the Jisgsaw validator. I don't think there is much I can do about it, and have added an image of it. 

![Font problem](/assets/readme-images/font-problem.png)

### Imagery
For the imagery of the site, I wanted to show cats doing what cats do best sleeping or getting up to no good. Cats have unique personalities and I tried to find pictures that once you looked at them you know there is a unique personality behind that face. I also wanted some soft tones to the pictures, but every now and then there is a pop of colour to the photos. My favourite colours are autumn colours (orange and brown), so you will find those colours throughout the site. 

### Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to bring my ideas to "life". There was a lot that I added to the wireframes, but I had to delete the cafe page due to time and had to let go of some of the ideas due to knowledge and time. I did add this to my future implementation section. Thank You page was not thought of right at the beginning. It was a page that was added towards the end of the project based on suggestion on the Slack community. I have added the Thank You image to the Feature section.

## Features

### General features on each page
- Nav/Menu

Nav/Menu bar has four main buttons situated on the right with the logo in the middle and title on the left. The logo and title are linked to the Home page, so when clicked in the other pages it will take the user back to the Home page. I used the same concept as in the Love Running project, where the menu buttons will highlight with a line on the bottom to let the user know which page they are on. The title, logo, and menu buttons do change position depending on screen sizes. The responsive image at the top of the READme show this. 

![Navigation and Menu](/assets/readme-images/nav-menu.png)

- Logo

The logo was sourced from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and I changed the colour to coincide with the autumn colours. 

![Logo](/assets/readme-images/logo-readme.png)

- Favicon

The favicon was taken from the logo that was sourced from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). 

![Favicon](/assets/readme-images/favicon-readme.png)

- Home Hero Image

In my wireframes, my Home hero image was different, but this image was picked due to it being a perfect representation of what the website is: Cats and Coffee!

![Home Hero Image](/assets/readme-images/home-hero-image.png)

- Home Introduction

The Home page is more of an overview of the People and Cats page. The Home Introduction section is more like the ethos in the Love Running project.

![Home Introduction](/assets/readme-images/home-intro.png)

- Home Cats

Here I tried to hit the main points about the Cats and who we partnered with to help with the adoption. I have attached a link to the DSPCA so users can click and it will take them directly to the DSPCA's website (People page also has this). I have also linked the Cats page so if the user wants to go directly to the Cats page from this point on the page they can. 

![Home Cats](/assets/readme-images/home-cats.png)

- Home People

This section is also a place where I tried to hit the main points about the People page. 

![Home People](/assets/readme-images/home-people.png)

- Footer

The footer houses the social networks logos: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. I also added that the Site was created for educational purposes. 

![Footer](/assets/readme-images/footer-social-networks.png)

- People Hero Image

Due to this page being called People page, I wanted a hero image that had a cat and a person. 

![People Hero Image](/assets/readme-images/people-hero-image.png)

- Mo and Eva

The Mo and Eva section, which has the heading of "Behind every idea there is a story..." is essentially the about us page. It starts with the story behind the idea of Whiskers N Whole Bean and Mo and Eva are the start of that. Mo and Eva are my actual cats and they were adopted. They do also have a brother called Thorin, who is a labrador. The image used here is my personal photo. 

![Mo and Eva](/assets/readme-images/people-mo-eva.png)

- People Rescue 

The Rescue section is where I go a bit more into detail about the reasons behind partnering up with the DSPCA. The word DSPCA is linked so the user can click and go straight to their website. I also mention if they want to go straight to meet the cats they can click on the Book Here link that I provided, which would take them straight to the Book Here page. 

![People Rescue](/assets/readme-images/people-rescue.png)

- People Cafe

In my wireframes, I dedicated a whole page to the cafe, but because of time I had to scrap it. But, it is a cat cafe, so I took this area to hit some of the points about the cafe.

![People Cafe](/assets/readme-images/people-cafe.png)

- Cats Hero Image

In my images, I wanted to show cats as natural as possible (like you would take a picture of them yourself at home). And, I think this picture was perfect. I also like it due to many cats housed in foster or rescue care are not always kittens, some of them might be a bit older. And, they are still awesome to adopt.

![Cats Hero Image](/assets/readme-images/cats-hero-image.png)

- Cats Main Text

The main text in this section mentions how the cats are named after literary characters or authors. I also mention reasons as to why users would need to book to see the cats. 

![Cats Main Text](/assets/readme-images/cats-page.png)

- Cats Gallery 

I took the idea of the gallery from the Love Running project. I wanted to convey cats just being cats that are housed in Whiskers N Whole Beans. I also tried to find images that showed some sort of personality to them. 

![Cat Gallery](/assets/readme-images/cats-gallery.png)

- Book Here Form

Book Here form was sourced from the Love Runnigng project, but tweaked it to fit the design of the website. I do like how round corners looked, so I round the book here box, the three inputs, and the Book Here! button. The radio buttons consists of Morning, Afternoon, Evening and these concide with the hours underneath the book here form. This allows the user to know what time of day they would like to visit. 

![Book Here Form](/assets/readme-images/book-here-form.png)

- Hours of Operation

Because of the booking element of the website, I added hours of operation to help guide the user in picking which time works best for them. Initally, I wanted to put this in the footer, but it was not cooperating with me. But, putting it under the Book Here form actually worked better. 

![Hours of Operation](/assets/readme-images/hours-operation.png)

- Our Location

The location is based on different places that I have lived with Mo and Eva all woven togther. The address together as a whole is not a actual address. 

![Our Location](/assets/readme-images/our-location.png)

- Thank You Page

Once the user enters their details and clicks Book Here! They are presented with a Thank You Page. The page lets them know that we have received the request and they should be receiving an email soon. 

![Thank You Page](/assets/readme-images/thank-you-page.png)

- Thank You Logo Stamp

The Thank You Stamp was created in Canva using the sourced cat logo. It conviently goes with the saying on the Thank You page of "You have received the seal of approval".

![Thank You Logo Stamp](/assets/readme-images/logo-stamp-readme.png)

### Future Implementations
- To set up a live feed of the cat area.
- Add a coffee page to the website - a coffee section was thought of in the wireframes, but it was a lot for my knowledge at the time and actual time. [Cafe Wireframe](/assets/wireframes-images/cafe-page-wireframe.png)
- Add a newsletter for updates on the cats or when cats are adopted - this was also part of my ideas at the beginning, but again knowledge and time. 
- In the book here section, add a Manage Your Reservation. A customer would be able to create an account sign-in and cancel their reservation or if they would need to reschedule - this was also an idea that I had at the beginning, but same issue as above. [Book Here Wireframe](/assets/wireframes-images/book-here-wireframe.png)
- I would like for the picture of the "cats" in the gallery, when a user hovers over them, they turn to reveal information of the cats. I had this idea, as well, from the beginning, but again same issue as above. [Cats Page Wireframe](/assets/wireframes-images/cats-page-wireframe.png)
- I know many of the future implementaions were ideas that I thought of from the beginning, but my knowledge is not there yet. As my knowledge grows I would like to test them on this project. 

### Accessibility
With every image and icon used throughout Whiskers N Whole Beans, I have added an aria-label or an alt attribute. I tried to use colour that was not to bright or light. The font is readable, but I do feel for future projects, I would do more research on what fonts are more accessible.

The desktop version for Lighthouse gave great numbers, but the mobile was not the greatest for Performance (image below). I would like to work on that and see what I can do to make that better. I used WAVE for the contrast, which gave back 0 errors (image below).

Lighthouse Desktop Version.

Lighthouse Mobile Version

## Credits

### Code Used
Whiskers N Whole Beans would be the first website I have ever built, so I relied on Code Institute's Love Running project to guide me through the process. Although I used it as a guide, I tweak the code to fit the website. For example, the menu in the navigation bar. The book here form was based on the Love Running project form, but tweaked it to fit the design of the website. 

### Content
Content was written by Amanda Pita. 

Much of the content came from personal experiences. For example, when I adopted Mo and Eva, I had to make an appointment before seeing them due to other cats being in the same house. I would later find out the reason for that, from personal experience, was because cats can become extremely stressful with changes in their environment. We moved from Ireland back to the States, and long story short there was a lot of vet visits due to an increase amount of stress. I am also a librarian, so of course, I would name the cats after literary characters or authors. 

### Media
Mo and Eva image in the People page is from my personal photos.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to first give thanks to my husband (who would look at me with a straight and understanding face when I was explaining to him what the code does). He was my rubber duck for the marjority of the project. 

I'm extremely grateful to my mentor Martina who guided me through the process and helped convince me that I'm doing fine and can actually do it! Helped me a lot especially when imposter symdrome started creeping in.
