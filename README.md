# Whiskers N Whole Beans
Whiskers N Whole Beans is my first project for Code Insitute. The idea came from my love for coffee, books, and, of course, cats. I do have two cats name Mo and Eva and their picture was used for the People page and I am also a librarian. My cats were actually in foster care when we got them, so that also sparked the idea and I was also influenced by the growing number of cat cafes popping up in various cities. And, personally I always wanted to open a coffeeshop and bakery. 

Whiskers N Whole Beans is a business's website. It is intended to give the user information on what the business is, what it does, and what they can do to avail of the services. I wanted to create a site that was welcoming without a crazy amount of colour, a lot of wording, or pictures. I wanted to make it simple and to the point, where it won't be overwhelming to customers, but it still had a bit of fun to it.

## User Experience (UX)

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme that I used for Whiskers N Whole Beans was more towards warm colours. The main idea of the site is to be a place where you can relax and feel at home. For many people, sitting on a chair with a cat on their lap purring, drinking tea or coffee, and having pastries can materialise warmth and relaxation. It does for me and bringing in some Autumn colours creates that atmosphere.

### Typography
Two fonts I used from Google Fonts where for the body Pangolin and for h1, h2, and h3 I used Shadows Into Light Two. My default font was Sans-serif. I decided on Pangolin and Shadows Into Light Two because of their playful. They capture the overall idea of the website, which is playful. Calm, but playful (just like the cats). I did have one problem that would show up in my editor (CSS), but passed the Jisgsaw validator. I don't think there is much I can do. I have added an image of it. 

- Shadow Into Light Two - Used for Headings

- Pangolin Font - Used for Body

- Font problem in editor

### Imagery
For the imagery of the site, I wanted to show cats doing what cats do best sleeping or getting up to no good. Cats have unique personalities and I tried to find pictures that once you looked at them you know there is a unique personality behind that face. I also wanted some soft tones to the pictures, but every now and then there is a pop of colour to the photos. My favourite colours are autumn colours (orange and brown), so you will find those colours throughout the site. 

### Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to bring my ideas to "life". There was a lot that I added to the wireframes, but I had to delete the cafe page due to time and had to let go of some of the ideas due to knowledge and time. I did add this to my future implementation section. Thank You page was not thought of at the beginning it was a page that was added towards the end of the project. I have added the Thank You image to the Feature section.

### Future Implementations
- To set up a live feed of the cat area.
- Add a coffee page to the website - a coffee section was thought of in the wireframes, but it was a lot for my knowledge at the time and actual time.
- Add a newsletter for updates on the cats or when cats are adopted - this was also part of my ideas at the beginning, but again knowledge and time. (add link to wireframe)
- In the book here section, add a Manage Your Reservation. A customer would be able to create an account sign-in and cancel or if they would need to rescedule - this was also an idea that I had at the beginning, but same issue as above. (add link to wireframe)
- I would like for the picture of the "cats" in the gallery, when you hover on them, they turn to reveal information on the cats. I had this idea, as well, from the beginning, but again same issue as above.
- I know many of the future implementaions were ideas that I thought of from the beginning, but my knowledge is not there yet. As my knowledge grows I would like to test them on this project. 

### Accessibility
With every image and icon used throughout Whiskers N Whole Beans I have added an aria-label or an alt attribute to enable screen readers to understand. I tried to use colour that was not to bright or light. The font is readable, but I do feel for future project I would do more research on what fonts are more accessible.

The desktop version for Lighthouse gave great numbers, but the mobile was not the greatest for Performance (image below). I would like to work on that and see what I can do to make that better. I used WAVE for the contrast, which gave back 0 errors (image below).

Lighthouse Desktop Version.

## Credits

### Code Used
Whiskers N Whole Beans would be the first website I have ever built, so I relied on Code Institute's Love Running project to guide me through the process. Although I used it as a guide, I tweak the code to fit the website. For example, the menu in the navigation bar. The book here form was based on the Love Running project form, but tweaked it to fit the design of the website. 

### Content
Content was written by Amanda Pita. 
Much of the content came from personal experiences. For example, when I adopted Mo and Eva, I had to make an appointment before seeing them due to other cats being in the same house. I would later find out the reason for that, from personal experience, was because cats can become extremely stressful with changes in their environment. We moved from Ireland back to the States, and long story short there was a lot of vet visits due to an increase amount of stress. Also, I'm a librarian, so of course, I would name the cats after literary characters or authors. 

### Media
Mo and Eva image in the People page is from my personal photos.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to first give thanks to my husband (who would look at me with a straight and understanding face when I was explaining to him what the code does). He was my rubber duck for the marjority of the project. 

I'm also eternally grateful to my mentor Martina who guided me through the process and helped convince me that I'm doing fine and can actually do it! Helped me a lot especially when imposter symdrome started creeping in.
