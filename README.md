# Whiskers N Whole Beans
Whiskers N Whole Beans is my first project for Code Insitute. The idea came from my love for coffee, books, and, of course, cats. I do have two cats name Mo and Eva and their picture was used for the People page and I am also a librarian. My cats were actually in foster care when we got them, so that also sparked the idea and I was also influenced by the growing number of cat cafes popping up in various cities. And, personally I always wanted to open a coffeeshop and bakery. 

Whiskers N Whole Beans is a business's website. It is intended to give the user information on what the business is, what it does, and what they can do to avail of the services. I wanted to create a site that was welcoming without a crazy amount of colour, a lot of wording, or pictures. I wanted to make it simple and to the point, where it won't be overwhelming to customers, but it still had a bit of fun to it.

### Imagery
For the imagery of the site, I wanted to show cats doing what cats do best sleeping or getting up to no good. Cats have unique personalities and I tried to find pictures that once you looked at them you know there is a unique personality behind that face. I also wanted some soft tones to the pictures, but every now and then there is a pop of colour to the photos. My favourite colours are autumn colours (orange and brown), so you will find those colours throughout the site.
