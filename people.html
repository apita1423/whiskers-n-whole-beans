                <p>Whiskers N Whole Beans's story started when Amanda, the "human" owner,
                    adopted two fostered cats, Mo and Eva. Together they went through late nights finishing
                    two
                    degrees, and many live changes. Amanda became a librarian and was completely happy with
                    the sterotype
                    of librarians seem to always have cats! When Mo and Eva were adopted, they were extremely distant
                    and
                    took awhile
                    for them to settle into their new home. Amanda thought, if foster cats can be in an
                    environment that
                    allows for interaction between people and cats, the process and transition of adopted cats would be
                    much smoother. With that,
                    and the love of coffee and pastries, Whiskers N Whole Beans was created. Mo and Eva are still
                    messing around with the addition
                    of a brother, Thorin, a labrador that keeps them on their toe beans.

                <p>Whiskers and Whole Beans is partnered with the DSPCA to house foster cats; this
                    allows for the cats
                    to have a larger area to roam and have interactions with customers. Having interaction with customers will allow them to become
                    accustomed to people petting or playing
                    with them. This increases the chances for the cats to find and stay in their forever home. The process for adoption is run through the DSPCA.

                not mean you can't enjoy your coffee with the kitties. You just might have a few trying to take a bite
                or sip. For the cat's safety, please don't
                give them human food.
