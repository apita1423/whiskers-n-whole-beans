                    <p>Whiskers N Whole Beans's story started when Amanda, the "human" owner, 
                       adopted two fostered cats, Mo and Eva. Together they went through many late nights trying to finish two
                       degrees, and many live changes. Amanda became a librarian/archivist and was completely happy with the sterotypes 
                       of all librarians seem to have cats! When Mo and Eva were adopted, they were extremely distance and took awhile
                       for them to become used to their new home and humans. Amanda thought, if fosters cat can be in an environment that 
                       allows for interaction between people and cats, the process and transition of adopted cats can be much smoother. With that,
                       and the love of coffee and pastries, Whiskers N Whole Beans was created. Mo and Eva are still messing around with the addition
                       of a brother Thorin, a labrador that keeps them on their toe beans.
